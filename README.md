# Resend CSM Activation Email Zendesk App

This **Zendesk App** is designed for in-house use. This app allows agents within Zendesk to enter the first name, last name, email, site-type (residence/business), and the desired membership level into the sidebar. Once the data has been entered and submitted, it will then be delivered to our backend systems and the appropriate customized **CSM Activation Email** will be sent to the client.

# Versions

There are 4 versions of the app with the only difference between each one being the available desired memberships based on the associated partner Zendesk that the app is installed within.
